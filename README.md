# Implementation-of-the-Line-Search-Algorithm

This project focuses on implementing optimization algorithms, specifically the Line Search and BFGS methods, to solve complex mathematical functions. The algorithms are designed to demonstrate principles in 
optimization theory and improve convergence rates in various scenarios.

# Part1
In this section, we intend to implement the line search algorithm along with the zoom algorithm. The line search algorithm with zoom is an iterative method used to find an appropriate step size (also known as step
length or learning rate) along a given search direction in optimization problems. It is commonly used in optimization algorithms such as gradient descent methods or conjugate gradient methods.
